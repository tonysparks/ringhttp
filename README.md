Ring-Http
==
An HTTP server using `io_uring` written purely in [LitaC](https://github.com/tonysparks/litac-lang).  This is still in heavy development and is not production quality - this was more for fun than for actual use (at least for now).

Features/TODO
==
* ✅ Multi-part support
* ✅ Transfer-Encoding: Chunked
    * ✅ From Request
    * ✅ From Response
* ❌ Transfer-Encoding: Gzip
* ✅ Transfer-Encoding: Deflate
* ✅ Form URL Encoded bodies
* ✅ Path Values
* ✅ Path Templates
* ✅ Query Params
* ✅ Headers
* ✅ Serve static files
* ✅ Connection Keep-Alive (with timeouts)
* ✅ Configurable max request sizes
* ❌ Split into segments: static and dynamic to minimize overall memory footprint
    * Currently all requests are given max/equal amount of memory
* ❌ Clean handling of Out of Memory
    * ❌ OOM for a request
    * ❌ OOM for the server
* ✅ __~840K__ Request/Second on single instance (Request Kind: parse Query Params and echo back in JSON)
    * ✅ Support multi-threading
* ❌ Do performance tuning
    * ❌ SIMD for HTTP parsing
    * ❌ Explore batching opportunities
* 🔧 Client API
    * ✅ Register routes handlers
    * ✅ Register routes with path templates
    * ✅ Allow for global server error handler
    * ✅ Allow for global 404 handler
    * ✅ Allow for setting raw body contents
    * ✅ Allow for chunked replies (via `Stream`)
    * ✅ Allow for specifying headers
    * ❌ API for specifying content-type (`response.json(..)` `response.html(..)`, etc.)
    * ❌ Template engine integration (mustache? custom?)
* ✅ WebSocket
* ❌ Test Suite

Building
==

This has only been tested on Ubuntu 22.04

__Setup and Build__

```shell
# Download the liburing litac bindings dependency (this only needs to be done once)
litac -pkg-install

# Build the project
litac -pkg-build
```

__Build and Run__
```shell
# Build the project and run the executable
litac -pkg-build -run
```

__Run executable__
```shell
# Run the generated executable without litac
./bin/ring
```
